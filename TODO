--Stuff to fix before first release:

* Ensure that streams shut down gracefully and that the Gadgetron is ready to start a new stream at all times. Sometimes it hangs after shutting down a stream.

* Add functionality for specifying the number of execution threads in the XML configuration. 

* Add Gadget3, Gadget4, Gadget5

* Make it possible for a reader to access an arbitrary Gadget in the chain

* Divide the archive into basics (gadgetron and examples) and development gadgets and apps that will not be distributed with the Gadgetron.

-- Stuff for later
- Add Event_Handler to Reactor to deal with key strokes and SIGINT to ensure graceful shutdown
- Logging server
- Data display
