--Stuff to fix before first release:

* Check and Debug GPU reconstructions on Windows (Grappa and CGSense) 

* Check and Debug PythonGadgets on Windows (Need 64-bit versions of Python, Numpy, Scipy, etc.)

* Add multiple (templated) versions of ExtractMagnitude for short, float, complex

* Enable clients to received floats and complex images.

* Speed up NoiseAdjustGadget by using BLAS for matrix-matrix multiplication

* Add ScalingGadget

* Add PCAGadget (PrincipleComponentAnalysis) for coil compression. This would calculate a decomposition matrix, which ideally would be combined with the noiseadjust matrix and applied in one operation for computational effciency. Specifically:

      * NoiseAdjustGadget just calculates noise covariance matrix
      * PCAGadget Calculated the PCA decomposition matrix.
      * VirtualCoilGadget queries these matrices from PCAGadget (if available) and NoiseAdjustGadget (if available), combined the matrices and applies them in one operation (using BLAS for efficiency)

* Add checks to mriclients (siemens and regular) to check if files exist to avoid crashes.

* Add help to clients

* Add loop to mriclient to enable hundreds of runs with the same dataset for debugging purposes. 

* Minor Issue: Why does siemens_mriclient only work in debug mode with debug versions of gadgetron libraries. 

* Minor Issue: Why is there an issue with VPN???

* Ensure that streams shut down gracefully and that the Gadgetron is ready to start a new stream at all times. Sometimes it hangs after shutting down a stream.

* Add functionality for specifying the number of execution threads in the XML configuration. 

* Add Gadget3, Gadget4, Gadget5

* Make it possible for a reader to access an arbitrary Gadget in the chain


-- Stuff for later
- Add Event_Handler to Reactor to deal with key strokes and SIGINT to ensure graceful shutdown
- Logging server
- Data display
