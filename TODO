--Stuff to fix before first release:

* Minor Issue: Why does siemens_mriclient only work in debug mode with debug versions of gadgetron libraries. 
* Ensure that streams shut down gracefully and that the Gadgetron is ready to start a new stream at all times. Sometimes it hangs after shutting down a stream.
* Add Gadget4, Gadget5
* Make it possible for a reader to access an arbitrary Gadget in the chain


-- Stuff for later
* Add Event_Handler to Reactor to deal with key strokes and SIGINT to ensure graceful shutdown
* Logging server
* Data display
