The ejection fraction in the patients was calculated based on images of a conventional two-dimensional gradient-echo technique using a biplane ellipsoid model. The results from k-space segmented methods (3 to 9 Fourier lines per cardiac cycle for each phase image) were compared with the conventional images of the same short-axis view separately for groups of subjects with normal and reduced ejection fraction.

	abstract = {Cine {MRI} is used for assessing cardiac function and flow and is typically based on a breath-held, segmented data acquisition. Breath holding is particularly difficult for patients with congestive heart failure or in pediatric cases. Real-time imaging may be used without breath holding or {ECG} triggering. However, despite the use of rapid imaging sequences and accelerated parallel imaging, real-time imaging typically has compromised spatial and temporal resolution compared with gated, segmented breath-held studies. A new method is proposed that produces a cardiac cine across the full cycle, with both high spatial and temporal resolution from a retrospective reconstruction of data acquired over multiple heartbeats during free breathing. The proposed method was compared with conventional cine images in 10 subjects. The resultant image quality for the proposed method (4.2 +/- 0.4) without breath holding or gating was comparable to the conventional cine (4.4 +/- 0.5) on a five-point scale {(P} = n.s.). Motion-corrected averaging of real-time acquired cardiac images provides a means of attaining high-quality cine images with many of the benefits of real-time imaging, such as free-breathing acquisition and tolerance to arrhythmias.},

Discrete regular sampling in k-t-space leads to periodic replication of the support region in x-f-space. Thus, the maximum acceleration achievable by {UNFOLD} is equivalent to the maximum packing of support regions in x-f-space. When the support region is separable along the x and f axes, the reconstruction can be performed separately for each k. {UNFOLD} can be combined with {SiMultaneous} Acquisition of Spatial Harmonics {(SMASH)} to further accelerate acquisition. However, a straightforward combination of the methods has been shown to result in a size restriction, which limits the portion of the field of view {(FOV)} with a larger temporal bandwidth to only a quarter of the {FOV.} Two solutions are presented to overcome this restriction.},

In this work we describe how {MF} can be applied to a series of images produced by cinematographic magnetic resonance (cine {MR)} to produce angiographic images. Likewise, a simple subtraction image can be formed by subtracting an image in which flow is not well visualized from an image at the same location but with flow visualization. Theory predicts that a subtraction image resulting from the {MF} technique will yield typical {SNR} improvements of 60\% over results from simple subtraction. Twenty-one studies of the human popliteal, canine aorta, and canine carotid artery were undertaken in which {MF} was compared with simple subtraction. It was determined that cine {MR} can be used to produce subtraction angiographic images and that {MF} can produce a modest improvement in {SNR} over simple subtraction.},

	abstract = {A fast {MR} angiography method is introduced that is capable of generating difference images of blood vessels in scan times of 10-20 s. This is an order of magnitude faster than many previous methods. The fundamental concept of this approach is to use cardiac gating and acquire several phase encodings at least twice during each cardiac cycle using limited flip angles {(LFAs)} and repetition times in the 20 to 50 ms range. The encodings acquired during diastole are subtracted from those acquired during systole to generate the difference image. The contrast in the difference image is due both to the influx of unsaturated spins and to the loss of phase coherence of systolic blood moving at high velocity along a magnetic gradient. The systolic peak of the cardiac cycle is determined during reconstruction by shifting the systolic and diastolic "windows" until the difference signal is maximized. Ghost artifacts due to pulsatile flow are eliminated by a phase reordering technique similar in concept to those developed for suppression of breathing artifacts. Arteries in thick slices are successfully imaged and initial in vivo results are presented.},

	abstract = {Motion of an object degrades {MR} images, as the acquisition is time-dependent, and thus k-space is inconsistently sampled. This causes ghosts. Current motion correction methods make restrictive assumptions on the type of motions, for example, that it is a translation or rotation, and use special properties of k-space for these transformations. Such methods, however, cannot be generalized easily to nonrigid types of motions, and even rotations in multiple shots can be a problem. Here, a method is presented that can handle general nonrigid motion models. A general matrix equation gives the corrupted image from the ideal object. Thus, inversion of this system allows us to get the ideal image from the corrupted one. This inversion is possible by efficient methods mixing Fourier transforms with the conjugate gradient method. A faster but empirical inversion is discussed as well as methods to determine the motion. Simulated three-dimensional affine data and two-dimensional pulsation data and in vivo nonrigid data are used for demonstration. All examples are multishot images where the object moves between shots. The results indicate that it is now possible to correct for nonrigid types of motion that are representative of many types of patient motion, although computation times remain an issue.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance {(MR)} imaging methods with good spatial and contrast resolution are often too slow to follow the uptake of contrast agents with the desired temporal resolution. Imaging can be accelerated by skipping the acquisition of data normally taken with strong phase-encoding gradients, restricting acquisition to weak-gradient data only. If the usual procedure of substituting zeroes for the missing data is followed, blurring results. Substituting instead reference data taken before or well after contrast agent injection reduces this problem. Volunteer and patient images obtained by using such reference data show that imaging can be usefully accelerated severalfold. Cortical and medullary regions of interest and whole kidney regions were studied, and both gradient- and spin-echo images are shown. The method is believed to be compatible with other acceleration methods such as {half-Fourier} reconstruction and reading of more than one line of k space per excitation.},

	abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in {MR} images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some {MR} images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes.

	abstract = {{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}

Two registration methods based on optical flow estimation have been programmed to run on a graphics programming unit {(GPU).} One of these methods by Horn \& Schunck is tested on a {4DCT} thorax data set with 10 phases and 41 landmarks identified per phase. The other method by Cornelius \& Kanade is tested on a series of six {3D} cone beam {CT} {(CBCT)} data sets and a conventional planning {CT} data set from a head and neck cancer patient. In each of these data sets 6 landmark points have been identified on the cervical vertebrae and the base of skull. Both {CBCT} to {CBCT} and {CBCT} to {CT} registration is performed.


{RESULTS}

For the {4DCT} registration average landmark error was reduced by deformable registration from 3.5+/-2.0 mm to 1.1+/-0.6 mm. For {CBCT} to {CBCT} registration the average bone landmark error was 1.8+/-1.0 mm after rigid registration and 1.6+/-0.8 mm after deformable registration. For {CBCT} to {CT} registration errors were 2.2+/-0.6 mm and 1.8+/-0.6 mm for rigid and deformable registration respectively. Using {GPU} hardware the Horn \& Schunck method was accelerated by a factor of 48. The {4DCT} registration can be performed in 37 seconds. The head and neck cancer patient registration takes 64 seconds.


{DISCUSSION}

Compared to image slice thickness, which limits accuracy of landmark point determination, we consider the landmark point accuracy of the registration acceptable. The points identified in the {CBCT} images do not give a full impression of the result of doing deformable registration as opposed to rigid registration. A larger validation study is being planned in which soft tissue landmarks will facilitate tracking the deformable registration. The acceleration obtained using {GPU} hardware means that registration can be done online for {CBCT.}},

	abstract = {A method of magnetic resonance image acquisition and reconstruction is described in which high imaging rates and fast reconstruction times are allowed. The acquisition is a modification of the basic {FLASH} sequence but with a restricted number N of phase encodings. The encodings are applied sequentially, periodically, and continuously. Images are formed by sliding a window of width N encodings along the acquired data and reconstructing an image for each position of the window. In general the acquisition time per image exceeds the time between successive images, and the method thus has a temporal lag. Experimental studies were performed with a dynamic phantom using 48 phase encodings and a {TR} of 20 ms, for an image acquisition time of about 1 s. The image display rate in the reconstructed sequence was 12.5 images/s, and the image sequence portrayed the motion of the phantom. Additional studies were done with 24 encodings. It is shown how the sliding window technique lends itself to high-speed reconstruction, with each newly acquired echo used to quickly update the image on display. The combination of the acquisition technique described and a hardware implementation of the reconstruction algorithm can result in realtime {MR} image acquisition and reconstruction.},

In addition, we implemented a real-time segmented echoplanar imaging pulse sequence and used it to quantify {LV} volume in 10 healthy volunteers.

The achieved reconstruction times are now well below the acquisition times, thus enabling real-time, interactive {SENSE} imaging, even with a large number of receive coils. The fast {GPU} reconstruction is also beneficial for datasets that are not acquired in real time. We demonstrate that it can be used for interactive adjustment of regularization parameters for k-t {SENSE} in the same way that one would adjust window and level settings.

	abstract = {In several applications, {MRI} is used to monitor the time behavior of the signal in an organ of interest; e.g., signal evolution because of physiological motion, activation, or contrast-agent accumulation. Dynamic applications involve acquiring data in a k-t space, which contains both temporal and spatial information. It is shown here that in some dynamic applications, the t axis of k-t space is not densely filled with information. A method is introduced that can transfer information from the k axes to the t axis, allowing a denser, smaller k-t space to be acquired, and leading to significant reductions in the acquisition time of the temporal frames. Results are presented for cardiac-triggered imaging and functional {MRI} {(fMRI)}, and are compared with data obtained in a conventional way. The temporal resolution was increased by nearly a factor of two in the cardiac-triggered study, and by as much as a factor of eight in the {fMRI} study. This increase allowed the acquisition of {fMRI} activation maps, even when the acquisition time for a single full time frame was actually longer than the paradigm cycle period itself. The new method can be used to significantly reduce the acquisition time of the individual temporal frames in certain dynamic studies. This can be used, for example, to increase the temporal or spatial resolution, increase the spatial coverage, decrease the total imaging time, or alter sequence parameters e.g., repetition time {(TR)} and echo time {(TE)} and thereby alter contrast.

	abstract = {A number of different methods have been demonstrated which increase the speed of {MR} acquisition by decreasing the number of sequential phase encodes. The {UNFOLD} technique is based on time interleaving of k-space lines in sequential images and exploits the property that the outer portion of the field-of-view is relatively static. The differences in spatial sensitivity of multiple receiver coils may be exploited using {SENSE} or {SMASH} techniques to eliminate the aliased component that results from undersampling k-space. In this article, an adaptive method of sensitivity encoding is presented which incorporates both spatial and temporal filtering. Temporal filtering and spatial encoding may be combined by acquiring phase encodes in an interleaved manner. In this way the aliased components are alternating phase. The {SENSE} formulation is not altered by the phase of the alias artifact; however, for imperfect estimates of coil sensitivities the residual artifact will have alternating phase using this approach. This is the essence of combining temporal filtering {(UNFOLD)} with spatial sensitivity encoding {(SENSE).} Any residual artifact will be temporally frequency-shifted to the band edge and thus may be further suppressed by temporal low-pass filtering. By combining both temporal and spatial filtering a high degree of alias artifact rejection may be achieved with less stringent requirements on accuracy of coil sensitivity estimates and temporal low-pass filter selectivity than would be required using each method individually. Experimental results that demonstrate the adaptive spatiotemporal filtering method (adaptive {TSENSE)} with acceleration factor R = 2, for real-time nonbreath-held cardiac {MR} imaging during exercise induced stress are presented.},

The authors present their results with the first two goals in volunteers. {MR} fluoroscopic image data were acquired with a limited flip angle pulse sequence with reduced repetition times {(TRs)} and fewer phase encodings used per image. The sequence was applied continuously, and images were formed by updating one set of data with data from the most recently taken measurements. Sample head images were generated with {TR/echo} times as small as 11/5.5 msec and 48 phase encodings for a total acquisition time of about 500 msec. Images were acquired while the volunteer flexed his head. Artifacts from the motion became less evident on images as progressively shorter acquisition times were used.},

	abstract = {New theoretical and practical concepts are presented for considerably enhancing the performance of magnetic resonance imaging {(MRI)} by means of arrays of multiple receiver coils. Sensitivity encoding {(SENSE)} is based on the fact that receiver sensitivity generally has an encoding effect complementary to Fourier preparation by linear field gradients. Thus, by using multiple receiver coils in parallel scan time in Fourier imaging can be considerably reduced. The problem of image reconstruction from sensitivity encoded data is formulated in a general fashion and solved for arbitrary coil configurations and k-space sampling patterns. Special attention is given to the currently most practical case, namely, sampling a common Cartesian grid with reduced density. For this case the feasibility of the proposed methods was verified both in vitro and in vivo. Scan time was reduced to one-half using a two-coil array in brain imaging. With an array of five coils double-oblique heart images were obtained in one-third of conventional scan time. Magn Reson Med 42:952-962, 1999.},

	abstract = {Real-time imaging may be clinically important in patients with congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, or in pediatric cases. However, real-time imaging typically has compromised spatial and temporal resolution compared with gated, segmented studies. To combine the best features of both types of imaging, a new method is proposed that uses parallel imaging to improve temporal resolution of real-time acquired images at the expense of signal-to-noise ratio {(SNR)}, but then produces an {SNR-enhanced} cine by means of respiratory motion-corrected averaging of images acquired in real-time over multiple heartbeats while free-breathing. The retrospective processing based on image-based navigators and nonrigid image registration is fully automated. The proposed method was compared with conventional cine images in 21 subjects. The resultant image quality for the proposed method (3.9+/-0.44) was comparable to the conventional cine (4.2+/-0.99) on a 5-point scale {(P=not} significant [n.s.]). The conventional method exhibited degraded image quality in cases of arrhythmias whereas the proposed method had uniformly good quality. Motion-corrected averaging of real-time acquired cardiac images provides a means of attaining high-quality cine images with many of the benefits of real-time imaging, such as free-breathing acquisition and tolerance to arrhythmias.},

	abstract = {This work investigated how the quality of prior information (i.e., data acquired during the training stage) influences k-t {BLAST} reconstruction. The impact of several factors, such as the amount of training data, the presence of spatial misregistration in the training data, and the effects of filtering, was investigated with simulations and in vivo data. It is shown that k-t {BLAST} outperforms sliding window reconstruction, even with very limited training data. By increasing the amount of training data, reconstruction error continues to decrease, albeit by a diminishing amount. However, an increased amount of training data also increases susceptibility to misregistration of the training data. Filtering of the training data with the goal of reducing truncation artifacts had only minor impact on reconstruction errors. Considering the balance among obtaining the most benefit from the training data, minimizing susceptibility to misregistration, and keeping data acquisition to a minimum, it is concluded that in cardiac imaging the training datasets should be limited to 10-20 profiles in k-space for a typical field of view. The training data may be acquired in a separate breathhold without much penalty, if care is taken to minimize misregistration, such as with a navigator.},

A standard phase-contrast {(PC)} sequence with interleaved acquisition of the velocity-encoded segments was modified to collect data in 2 stages, a high-resolution under sampled and a low-resolution fully sampled training stage. In addition, a modification of the k-t reconstruction strategy was tested. This strategy, denoted as "plug-in," incorporates data acquired in the training stage into the final reconstruction for improved data consistency, similar to conventional keyhole. "k-t {SENSE} plug-in" was found to provide best image quality and most accurate flow quantification. For this strategy, at least 10 training profiles are required to yield accurate stroke volumes (relative deviation {\textless}5\%) and good image quality. In vivo {2D} cine velocity mapping was performed in 6 healthy volunteers with 30-32 cardiac phases (spatial resolution 1.3 x 1.3 x 8-10 mm(3), temporal resolution of 18-38 ms), yielding relative stroke volumes of 106 +/- 18\% (mean +/- {2*SD)} and 112 +/- 15\% for 3.8 x and 5.3 x net accelerations, respectively. In summary, k-t {BLAST} and k-t {SENSE} are promising approaches that permit significant scan-time reduction in {PC} velocity mapping, thus making high-resolution breath-held flow quantification possible.},

A constant azimuthal profile spacing (111.246 degrees), based on the Golden Ratio, is investigated as optimal for image reconstruction from an arbitrary number of profiles in radial {MRI.} The profile order is evaluated and compared with a uniform profile distribution in terms of signal-to-noise ratio {(SNR)} and artifact level. The favorable characteristics of such a profile order are exemplified in two applications on healthy volunteers. First, an advanced sliding window reconstruction scheme is applied to dynamic cardiac imaging, with a reconstruction window that can be flexibly adjusted according to the extent of cardiac motion that is acceptable. Second, a contrast-enhancing k-space filter is presented that permits reconstructing an arbitrary number of images at arbitrary time points from one raw data set. The filter was utilized to depict the T1-relaxation in the brain after a single inversion prepulse. While a uniform profile distribution with a constant angle increment is optimal for a fixed and predetermined number of profiles, a profile distribution based on the Golden Ratio proved to be an appropriate solution for an arbitrary number of profiles.},

	abstract = {In k-t {BLAST} and k-t {SENSE}, data acquisition is accelerated by sparsely sampling k-space over time. This undersampling in k-t space causes the object signals to be convolved with a point spread function in x-f space (x = spatial position, f = temporal frequency). The resulting aliasing is resolved by exploiting spatiotemporal correlations within the data. In general, reconstruction accuracy can be improved by controlling the k-t sampling pattern to minimize signal overlap in x-f space. In this work, we describe an approach to obtain generally favorable patterns for typical image series without specific knowledge of the image series itself. These optimized sampling patterns were applied to free-breathing, untriggered (i.e., real-time) cardiac imaging with steady-state free precession {(SSFP).} Eddy-current artifacts, which are otherwise increased drastically in {SSFP} by the undersampling, were minimized using alternating k-space sweeps. With the synergistic combination of the k-t approach with optimized sampling and {SSFP} with alternating k-space sweeps, it was possible to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio, high contrast, and high spatiotemporal resolutions, while achieving substantial immunity against eddy currents. Cardiac images are shown, demonstrating excellent image quality and an in-plane resolution of approximately 2.0 mm at {\textgreater}25 frames/s, using one or more receiver coils.},

These times have exceeded the underlying acquisition time thus preventing real-time display of the acquired images.

This allows the temporal resolution to be adjusted on the fly. A user adaptable regularization term is also included and, particularly for highly undersampled data, used to interactively improve the reconstruction quality. Each reconstruction is fully self-contained from the profile stream, i.e., the required coil sensitivity profiles, sampling density compensation weights, regularization terms, and noise estimates are computed in real-time from the acquisition data itself. The reconstruction implementation is verified using a steady state free precession {(SSFP)} pulse sequence and quantitatively evaluated. Three applications are demonstrated; real-time imaging with real-time {SENSE} 1) or k- t {SENSE} 2) reconstructions, and 3) offline reconstruction with interactive adjustment of reconstruction settings.},

	abstract = {New, efficient reconstruction procedures are proposed for sensitivity encoding {(SENSE)} with arbitrary k-space trajectories. The presented methods combine gridding principles with so-called conjugate-gradient iteration. In this fashion, the bulk of the work of reconstruction can be performed by fast Fourier transform {(FFT)}, reducing the complexity of data processing to the same order of magnitude as in conventional gridding reconstruction. Using the proposed method, {SENSE} becomes practical with nonstandard k-space trajectories, enabling considerable scan time reduction with respect to mere gradient encoding. This is illustrated by imaging simulations with spiral, radial, and random k-space patterns. Simulations were also used for investigating the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm and its dependence on the factor by which gradient encoding is reduced. The in vivo feasibility of {non-Cartesian} {SENSE} imaging with iterative reconstruction is demonstrated by examples of brain and cardiac imaging using spiral trajectories. In brain imaging with six receiver coils, the number of spiral interleaves was reduced by factors ranging from 2 to 6. In cardiac real-time imaging with four coils, spiral {SENSE} permitted reducing the scan time per image from 112 ms to 56 ms, thus doubling the frame-rate.},

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} To develop and test an automatic free-breathing, delayed enhancement imaging method with improved image signal-to-noise ratio {(SNR).} {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS} The proposed approach uses free-breathing, inversion-recovery single-shot fast imaging with steady precession {(FISP)} delayed-enhancement with respiratory motion compensation based on nonrigid image registration. Motion-corrected averaging is used to enhance {SNR.} {RESULTS} Fully automatic, nonrigid registration was compared to previously validated rigid body registration that required user interaction. The performance was measured using the variance of edge positions in intensity profiles through the myocardial infarction {(MI)} enhanced region and through the right ventricular {(RV)} wall. Measured variation of the {MI} edge was 1.16 +/- 0.71 mm {(N} = 6 patients; mean +/- {SD)} for rigid body and 1.08 +/- 0.76 mm for nonrigid registration (no significant difference). On the other hand, significant improvement {(P} {\textless} 0.005) was found in the measurements at the {RV} edge where the {SD} was 2.06 +/- 0.56 mm for rigid body and 0.59 +/- 0.22 mm for nonrigid registration. {CONCLUSION} The proposed approach achieves delayed enhancement images with high resolution and {SNR} without requiring a breathhold. Motion correction of free-breathing delayed-enhancement imaging using nonrigid image registration may be implemented in a fully automatic fashion and performs uniformly well across the full field of view {(FOV).}},
